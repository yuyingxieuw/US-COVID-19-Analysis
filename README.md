# US Covid-19 Data Visulalization 
## Project Introduction 
This project aims at mapping covid cases on the county level in the Unitied Sates in 2020. The first covid case emerged in king county Washington State in January 2020,  and until now it has killed [at least 1,111,485](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-us-maps-and-cases/) people and infected about 102.6 million in the Unitied States, according to the data by Johns Hopkins University. And therefore, tracking Covid-19 cases is relatively important in understanding its spreading features and putting forward coping strategies accordingly. Particually, the spatial feature of Covid cases and rates are significant, through which we can explore why certain places has more cases or higher rates and what factsrs lead to a certain kind of spatial pattern. Thus, this project tries to visualize spatial data of Covid-19 rates and cases in the United States in 2020 by county to show the spatial pattern to help better trace the spreading of the pendemic. 
## Mapping Result
1. The first map is a cholopleth map showing Covid-19 rates (cases/population) in each county. We use the [Mapbox Light v10](https://www.mapbox.com/maps/light) as the basemap. The U.S. county boundary shapefile was collected from the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html); The Covid-19 case data was downloated from [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/43d32dde2f87bd4dafbb7d23f5d9e878124018b8/live/us-counties.csv). And the population data used for calculating the case rates are from the [2018 ACS 5 year estimates](https://data.census.gov/table?g=0100000US$050000&d=ACS+5-Year+Estimates+Data+Profiles&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&hidePreview=true). **Open the [map] and ou can click each polygon to see the specfic data**
